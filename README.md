## VSVG patterns

This is a little experiment to generate a tiling pattern using [vsvg](https://github.com/jcblw/vsvg) and [vsvg-paths](https://github.com/jcblw/vsvg-paths).

Edit the array of points to see the pattern change! For more info about points see [vsvg-path](https://github.com/jcblw/vsvg-paths).
